## Decisions Detail

### upload-processing/TD-01

**Recommendation:** matches the architecture diagram, keeps one S3 client shared with `@tus/s3-store` if TD-02 picks tus, and makes the storage service swappable by config. Option C is listed to be ruled out explicitly: it forecloses the diagram's "Frontend streams from Object Storage" edge and both TD-07 delivery options that depend on presigned URLs.
**Libraries:** @aws-sdk/client-s3, @aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner

### upload-processing/TD-02

**Recommendation:** it is the only option that simultaneously honors the strict-BFF decision, the architecture diagram's "API uploads to storage" edge, and the resume-after-failure requirement with a battle-tested protocol instead of hand-rolled part bookkeeping. The double-hop byte path is the honest price; it is memory-flat (streamed, chunked) and acceptable at this project's scale — and if it ever becomes the bottleneck, the migration path is Option D for the byte plane while keeping the same draft/finalize domain endpoints. Depends on TD-01 Option A (shared `@aws-sdk/client-s3`). TD-09 (FE upload client) depends on this choice.
**Libraries:** @tus/server, @tus/s3-store

### upload-processing/TD-03

**Recommendation:** the workload is low-throughput and correctness-critical, which is exactly pg-boss's sweet spot: transactional enqueue closes the job-loss race structurally, and no new broker enters the stack. This follows the project's established bias (Postgres over Redis in `phase-02-auth/TD-03`, custom guards over Passport). BullMQ is the right call if the team weighs official NestJS documentation and dashboard tooling above infra minimalism — flag it as the runner-up, not a wrong answer.
**Libraries:** pg-boss

### upload-processing/TD-04

**Recommendation:** delivers the diagram's container isolation and the performance guarantee at the cost of one bootstrap file, without the code duplication of Option C. Option B is disqualified by the phase requirement itself.
**Libraries:** —

### upload-processing/TD-05

**Recommendation:** with fluent-ffmpeg dead, a thin in-house wrapper over two well-defined CLI invocations is smaller than any wrapper dependency, and Docker-based provisioning matches the project's container-only execution rule. ffmpeg.wasm was considered and excluded as an option: WASM-side processing of 10GB files is orders of magnitude slower and memory-bound.
**Libraries:** —

### upload-processing/TD-06

**Recommendation:** the standard tool for exactly this job: short, URL-safe, non-enumerable, with the DB constraint converting probabilistic uniqueness into the plan's "nunca conflite" guarantee. Generated at draft creation (TD-02 handshake) so the URL exists from the first moment of the video's life.
**Libraries:** nanoid

### upload-processing/TD-07

**Recommendation:** it is what the architecture diagram already commits to, and it is the only option consistent with the phase's performance stance for a 10GB-file platform. The BFF exception is principled and narrow: *media bytes* go direct with expiring signed URLs; *all application data* stays behind the BFF. Requires TD-08 to be decided with it.
**Libraries:** —

### upload-processing/TD-08

**Recommendation:** two env keys and one extra `S3Client` solve the signature-host problem with zero new infrastructure, and the prod migration is a config value change. Follows the same config conventions already in place (`registerAs('storage', ...)` + Joi). Option C becomes attractive only when a real deployment fronts storage with a CDN — note it for Fase 07 (production environment).
**Libraries:** —

### upload-processing/TD-09

**Recommendation:** the project already owns a design system and a form pattern; it needs a transfer engine, not a UI framework. Uppy's weight buys features (multi-file, remote sources, editors) outside Phase 03's scope. Depends on TD-02 (tus variants).
**Renders in:** frontend-runtime
**Libraries:** tus-js-client

### upload-processing/TD-10

**Recommendation:** the status transition is minutes-scale and page-scoped; polling one REST endpoint that must exist anyway is the proportionate answer and keeps every established pattern (BFF, OpenAPI, MSW) untouched. If a later phase adds genuinely real-time features, revisit with SSE as the natural upgrade; nothing chosen here forecloses it.
**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Decisions Detail

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/config) — Official, core-team-maintained, guaranteed NestJS 11 compatibility. The `registerAs()` factory pattern solves the TypeORM CLI sharing problem: the factory function can be imported as a plain function by `data-source.ts` while also serving as a DI injection token inside NestJS. Building a custom module recreates solved functionality; third-party packages carry maintenance risk.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/config@^4.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (Joi) — First-class integration with `@nestjs/config` via `validationSchema`, requiring zero custom wiring. Handles string-to-number coercion natively. Using a different tool for env validation vs. request validation is reasonable — env config is validated once at startup, DTOs are validated per-request. Zod is elegant but adds a third validation paradigm to the project.

**Libraries:** `joi@^17.x`

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Namespaced/grouped with registerAs) — The project roadmap explicitly calls for auth, email, and storage in upcoming phases. Namespaced configs provide clear file boundaries per domain, typed injection via `ConfigType<typeof databaseConfig>`, and natural scalability. The `registerAs()` factory is dual-purpose: DI token inside NestJS and plain importable function for `data-source.ts`. Initial files for Phase 01: `src/config/database.config.ts`, `src/config/app.config.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-01-configuracao-base/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (Shared registerAs factory) — Natural outcome of choosing `@nestjs/config` with `registerAs`. The factory is already callable by design. `data-source.ts` imports it, calls `dotenv.config()`, then calls the factory. Zero duplication, minimal code, no extra abstraction.

**Libraries:** `dotenv` (transitive via `@nestjs/config`)

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.

**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.

**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.

**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.

**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority — Auth.js's value (DB adapters, OAuth providers, magic-link, `getServerSession` helpers) is mostly unused in this configuration. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern; a misconfigured Auth.js callback is a longer fault-isolation loop. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use; Auth.js v5 versions track Next.js majors with a lag, adding compatibility risk that Option A does not have. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout (one `session.destroy()` call) and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode of Option A. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome (avatar, channel name) without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip — Phase 04+ gains compound here. Option A is a viable downgrade if the team rejects `iron-session` for any reason; the migration A→B (or B→A) is a one-Route-Handler refactor with no test changes downstream because the BFF interface is unchanged. Option C is rejected: it solves a problem (server-side revocation) the project does not have at the cost of infrastructure the project does not own.

**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh) — adopting B means doing both. Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving and force a `"use client"` shell near the root.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions; the form code does not change if TD-05 is revisited later. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — the project already commits to `radix-nova` shadcn (`components.json`); `npx shadcn@latest add form` produces react-hook-form wrappers; choosing react-hook-form means using the supported primitive instead of hand-rolling around it. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation** — `next-frontend-config-base/TD-01` chose Zod 4 for env; the same schemas-as-source-of-truth pattern carries to forms with zero new validator paradigm. Option B is rejected for impedance with shadcn's primitive and for over-investing in progressive-enhancement that the strict-BFF model does not require. Option C is rejected for the per-field boilerplate and the loss of client-side feedback on a project that values quick, type-safe form iteration.

**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` named Route Handlers as the BFF surface; Option A keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** — `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Testing and `next-frontend-msw-foundation` were authored for Route-Handlers-as-functions; Option A reuses them with zero invention. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking when the cost of inconsistency compounds (Option C). Option B has real ergonomic appeal for the simplest forms but fragments the BFF surface and forces test-pattern reinvention; if the team later wants progressive enhancement for specific forms, the migration A→B is per-form and doesn't require touching unrelated routes — A is the safer default and the cheaper baseline.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML; the Client Provider hydrates with the correct initial state; users never see "Login" briefly turn into their avatar. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it; the BFF surface stays minimal. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price (one line in the relevant mutation handler) for the structural benefits. Option B is rejected for the double-read-and-flicker; Option C is dominated by Option B and rejected.

**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint, no skeleton, no flicker. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — confirmation is RSC-only; reset is RSC + Client form (TD-04, TD-05 patterns reused) — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level (a small note for `/plan-build` to confirm; not a separate TD). Option B's Route-Handler-as-link-target adds redirects for no clean gain. Option C is dominated.

**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (Zod 4) — Three converging reasons: (1) **Type-inference matches the FE's strict-TS culture** — `lib/env.ts` exports a typed `env` object with no `as` casts, satisfying the project's "Type Safety" working principle. (2) **Ecosystem gravity in Next.js / React 19** — Zod is the de-facto schema language for App Router (Server Actions inputs, form resolvers, future contract validation), so introducing it once at the env layer compounds value for forms in Phase 02+. (3) **Direct enablement of TD-02 Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`)** — t3-env's first-citizen validator. Backend parity with Joi is not load-bearing: env schemas are not shared FE↔BE (different runtimes, different key sets); two validators across two subprojects is a bounded cost.

**Libraries:** zod

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (`@t3-oss/env-nextjs`) — The only option that combines (i) **type-level NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix enforcement**, (ii) **runtime Proxy-based leak detection**, and (iii) **single-file, single-import-path consumer ergonomics**. Option B reaches roughly the same _structural_ outcome at higher implementation and maintenance cost, with a weaker guarantee (no prefix enforcement, no proxy). Option C is unsafe at any non-trivial team size. The marginal cost over B is one ~3KB dep — well-spent for the strongest boundary among the three.

**Libraries:** @t3-oss/env-nextjs

### next-frontend-config-base/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Strict BFF — single server-only `API_URL`) — Aligned with the BFF testing strategy and architectural commitment already documented in `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` (Route Handlers as the only NestJS caller; BFF tests stub `fetch` via MSW). Eliminates CORS, eliminates public exposure of the backend URL, and produces the smallest correct foundation. Option B's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is a future-proofing concession with no current consumer — and adding a public key later is a non-breaking change, while removing one is breaking. Option C ties a foundational decision to infra work explicitly deferred elsewhere. The Docker networking gap (how server-in-container resolves the backend) is a separate orthogonal decision, surfaced in the source doc as an out-of-scope ancillary note.

**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (`openapi-typescript` + `openapi-fetch`) — Three reinforcing reasons. (1) **Strict BFF makes the SDK surface valueless on the client.** Only Route Handlers ever call the upstream Nest; they already use `fetch` (Next 16's caching extensions sit on top of native `fetch`); a generated SDK adds a third client style to learn for zero functional gain. (2) **Types-first matches the rest of the FE foundation.** Env validation is Zod-derived types; component variants are `cva` types; both are TS-first with zero generated runtime. `paths` is the natural extension — one `.d.ts` file imported wherever the contract is touched. (3) **MSW typing is solved by the same `paths` symbol.** Hand-written handlers in `mocks/handlers.ts` type their resolver returns off `paths["/videos"]["get"]["responses"][200]`, giving the contract guarantee without orval/kubb's verbose generated handlers (which would be overridden per-test anyway). The marginal cost of adding `openapi-fetch` (~6KB, server-side only) is small enough that the **types + thin-client** pair is recommended, not types alone — `openapi-fetch` removes the `fetch(API_URL + path, { method, headers, body })` boilerplate in each Route Handler while staying within the BFF model. Options B/C/D may be revisited if (a) client-side data-fetching enters the stack with TanStack Query and per-endpoint hooks are wanted, or (b) the API grows beyond ~20 operations and per-call boilerplate becomes painful.

**Libraries:** openapi-typescript, openapi-fetch

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option B (committed local copy + repo-root sync script) — Three reasons. (1) **Preserves the compose-stack independence** that `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` Context calls out as the current architecture — neither subproject's compose file references the other. (2) **Drift is eliminated structurally when paired with TD-03's CI freshness check** — the check runs the sync script and asserts no diff on either `openapi.json` or `types.gen.ts`, so a backend PR that forgets to re-sync fails CI with a clear message. (3) **The committed local file is a real artifact in PR review** — reviewers see the contract change in `next-frontend/openapi.json`'s diff at the same time as the backend change, doubling the visibility (an `openapi.json`-only diff in a feature PR is a red flag for accidental drift). Option A is acceptable as a pre-CI fallback; Option C is rejected because the cross-stack file dependency in `docker-compose.yaml` introduces coupling that the current architecture explicitly avoids, and the "no drift" gain over B is small once TD-03 lands.

**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option C (committed + CI freshness check) — It is the only option that makes contract drift _both_ visible (in PR diffs) _and_ impossible to merge accidentally (CI fail). The complexity premium over Option A is one CI step. Option B's "no committed artifacts" purity is poorly paid for in a monorepo where the cross-subproject build coupling becomes a real ergonomic cost, and it wastes the PR visibility that TD-02 Option B's committed `openapi.json` is specifically designed to deliver. Option A is acceptable as a temporary state until the CI pipeline lands; downgrading from C to A is reversible (just remove the CI step) but upgrading to C later requires explaining `types.gen.ts` history in a separate commit. Start at C. Apply the same script-and-check pattern to any future generated artifact (e.g., if `openapi-fetch` is wrapped, the wrapper file is hand-written; the only generated artifact remains `types.gen.ts`).

**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option A (single `lib/api/contracts.ts` with explicit aliases) — It is the only option that (i) handles pass-through and reshape with the same mechanism, (ii) gives a single grep target for "what shape does the BFF expose", and (iii) decouples Component imports from App Router file paths (Components import `from "@/lib/api/contracts"`, not `from "@/app/api/videos/route"`). Option B is theoretically minimal but fragile against Next's actual RSC/Client/Route-Handler typing; Option C scatters the contract surface and creates drift opportunities. The "long file" concern is bounded — for the scope of StreamTube, the BFF will likely have <30 contract aliases at peak; sectioning by feature header comments is sufficient. Make `lib/api/contracts.ts` the only file that imports `paths` from `types.gen.ts` (lintable later); every other consumer imports from `contracts.ts`.

**Libraries:** —

### next-frontend-openapi-typing/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (hand-written, typed via `paths`) — Reasons: (1) **Determinism over auto-generation** — BFF integration tests assert on specific values; randomized fixtures are anti-helpful. (2) **Coherence with TD-01 recommendation** — `openapi-typescript`'s `paths` type is the single contract anchor; reusing it in MSW handlers means "spec ↔ handler ↔ assertion" is one type chain. (3) **Scale fit** — Phase 02 introduces few endpoints; the manual cost is negligible at this stage. If the API grows to dozens of endpoints and authoring overhead becomes real, this TD can be superseded with a Kubb-or-hey-api MSW plugin without touching TD-01's `paths` import sites (the generator just produces additional handler files; the existing manual handlers stay valid). Option B locks the project into a heavier TD-01 choice for marginal mock-authoring savings; Option C is Option A with an unnecessary detour.

**Libraries:** —

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Option A (`@nestjs/swagger`) — é a única opção que preserva as decisões anteriores (`class-validator` em TD-06 de phase-02-auth) sem re-platform; o CLI plugin com `classValidatorShim: true` aproveita os decoradores `class-validator` existentes para inferir schemas, mantendo o boilerplate baixo. Nestia tem mérito técnico real mas o custo de migração do stack de validação inviabiliza-a sem uma decisão upstream de supersede de TD-06. Manual authoring é descartado.

- 2026-05-12 — Esclarece que o CLI plugin (`classValidatorShim: true`) cobre apenas inferência de schemas de DTOs a partir de `class-validator`; documentação de operações, respostas tipadas por status code, contratos de erro (alinhados ao envelope de phase-02-auth/TD-07) e exemplos exigem decoradores explícitos (`@ApiOperation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@ApiBody`, `@ApiParam`, `@ApiQuery`, `@ApiExtraModels`). _Rationale:_ openapi.json gerado pelo bootstrap atual está genérico — sem detalhes de parâmetros, schemas de retorno por status, nem contratos de erro — porque a base instalada se apoiou só na introspecção automática. Esta revisão fixa que enriquecimento via decoradores explícitos faz parte da Option A escolhida, não é trabalho fora do escopo do TD.

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option C (Ambos) — o custo marginal sobre Option A é apenas um npm script (~15 linhas) e o benefício é uma fundação correta para futura integração FE (codegen offline) sem perder a UI interativa que dev/QA usam. Option B sozinho pune a experiência de desenvolvimento em dev/local; Option A sozinho compromete o pipeline de codegen futuro. Combinar é dominante.

### openapi-docs-nestjs/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option B (Apenas em dev/staging) — alinha com a postura defensiva já estabelecida em phase 02 e não compromete consumidores legítimos (o `openapi.json` commitado em TD-02 cumpre o papel de "spec consultável fora da UI"). Re-abrir como Option A ou C é trivial no futuro se um caso de uso de API pública aparecer.

## Inherited Conventions

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOpti... _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function... _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and... _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options... _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de frontend | deferred | phase-01-configuracao-base | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

## UI Inventory

_Frontend-runtime only — no screen inventory needed for this phase.
Run /screen-inventory upload-processing if a UI surface is added in a future revision._

## Non-UI / Deferred Capabilities

_None._

## Testing Requirements

### nestjs-project

| Artifact type | Required layers |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Entity (`*.entity.ts`) | Integration: constraints, defaults, `select: false` |
| Service with branching + DB | Unit: branch logic (mock repo) + Integration: DB contract |
| Service with DB only (no branching) | Integration: DB contract |
| Service with configured lib (JWT, cache) | Unit: real lib with test config |
| Service with side-effect dep (email, storage) | Integration: real capture service (Mailpit) or local adapter |
| Module with configured imports | Unit: compilation test |
| Controller | E2E only — do NOT write unit tests |
| DTO | E2E: one validation wiring test per endpoint |
| Guard (delegates to service for business logic) | E2E + Unit if complex internal logic |
| Guard (simple, delegates to Passport) | E2E only |
| Strategy (Passport) | E2E via guard |
| Pipe (custom transformation/validation) | Unit |
| Interceptor (response transform, logging) | Unit and/or E2E |
| Exception Filter | Unit + E2E |
| Middleware | E2E |

### next-frontend

| Artifact type | Required layers |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Page — sync RSC, static, no logic | None at component level; cover only if part of a critical flow → `*.e2e-spec.ts` |
| Page — sync RSC composing client children | Test client children directly; cover rendered page via `*.e2e-spec.ts` |
| Page — async RSC (`async function Page()` with `await`) | `*.e2e-spec.ts` only — Vitest cannot render it |
| Layout (`layout.tsx`) | None unless it adds logic (auth gate, conditional render); else via E2E |
| Client component (`"use client"`) with state/handlers | `*.test.tsx` — RTL + `jsdom` docblock, mock `next/navigation`, MSW for fetch |
| Feature component (server, composes primitives) | Skip unit; cover via the page's E2E |
| shadcn UI primitive (`components/ui/*`) | None — trust the library; cover via consumers |
| Icon (`components/icons/*`) | None |
| `lib/` utility / boundary module with branching or shape assumptions | `*.test.ts` |
| Custom hook (`hooks/*`) | `*.test.ts(x)` with `renderHook`, `jsdom` docblock |
| Route handler (`app/api/**/route.ts`) — proxy or with branching | `*.integration.test.ts` with MSW (+ `*.test.ts` for extracted pure logic) |
| Server action / middleware / error-loading-not-found / metadata | Depends on type — see `artifacts/future-types.md` |
